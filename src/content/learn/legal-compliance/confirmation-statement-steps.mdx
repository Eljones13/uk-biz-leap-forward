Every UK company must file an annual Confirmation Statement with Companies House. Here's exactly how to do it without penalties.

## What is a Confirmation Statement?

The CS01 confirms your company information is up-to-date, including:
- Registered office address
- Directors and shareholders
- Share capital details  
- Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes
- People with Significant Control (PSC)

<Callout type="warning">
Late filing results in penalties starting at £150, rising to £750+ for persistent delays.
</Callout>

## When to File

- **Due Date**: 12 months from incorporation, then annually

## Avoid Common Mistakes
