Building strong business credit is essential for accessing funding, better supplier terms, and growth opportunities. Unlike personal credit, business credit can be built relatively quickly with the right strategy.

Here's your step-by-step roadmap to building business credit from scratch.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

### 1. Incorporate Your Business
- Register with Companies House

- This creates your legal business entity

### 2. Open a Business Bank Account
- Keep business and personal finances separate
- Maintain **clean bank statements** for 90+ days
- Avoid overdrafts and returned payments
- Show regular business activity

### 3. Get Listed with Credit Bureaus
- Ensure your company appears on:
  - **Experian Business**
  - **Equifax Business**
  - **Creditsafe**
- This happens automatically after incorporation

### 4. Establish Trade Credit
- Set up accounts with suppliers who report to credit bureaus
- Pay invoices on time or early
- Ask suppliers to report positive payment history

## Phase 2: First Credit Products (Months 3-6)

### Business Credit Card Application
**When:** After 90 days of clean banking  
**Start with:** ¬£500-¬£1,000 credit limit  
**Key tips:**
