Starting a business in the UK? One of the first (and most important) steps is registering with **Companies House**. Setting up a limited company gives you legal protection, credibility, and access to business banking and credit.

Here's a complete, step-by-step guide to getting it done quickly and correctly in 2025.

## 1. Choose Your Company Name
- Must be unique and not "too similar" to another.  
- Check availability with the [Companies House name checker](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk).  
- Avoid restricted or sensitive words without permission.

## 2. Decide on Company Type
- **Private Company Limited by Shares (Ltd):** Standard option.  
- **Company Limited by Guarantee:** Often used by non-profits.  
- **CIC (Community Interest Company):** For social enterprises.

## 3. Provide a Registered Office Address
- Must be a UK address.  
- Appears on the public record.  
- You can use your accountant's or a virtual office.

## 4. Appoint Directors & Shareholders
- At least one director (over 16, not disqualified).  
- Shareholders can be the same as directors.  
- Record **People with Significant Control (PSC)**.

## 5. Assign SIC Codes
- SIC = Standard Industrial Classification.  
- Identifies what your business does.  
- Choose up to 4 codes.

## 6. Decide on Share Structure
- Most new companies issue **100 shares at Â£1 each**.  
- Split shares as agreed.

## 7. Prepare Key Documents
- **Memorandum of Association** (auto-generated online).  
- **Articles of Association** (use "Model Articles" or custom).

## 8. File with Companies House
- Online: Â£12, usually approved within 24 hours.  
- Paper: Â£40, takes longer.  
- Once accepted, you'll get a **Certificate of Incorporation**.

## 9. Next Steps
- Open a [Business Bank Account](/banking).  
- Register for Corporation Tax.  
- Keep statutory records.  
- File annual Confirmation Statements and accounts.
